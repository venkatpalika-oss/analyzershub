    <h1>Why CEMS Exists – Origin and Significance</h1>

    <p><strong>
      Emissions were once checked occasionally.
      Today, they are monitored continuously.
    </strong></p>

    <p>
      Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems (CEMS) exist because
      periodic testing could not represent real plant operation.
      Regulators, operators, and communities required continuous visibility.
    </p>

    <blockquote class="field-tip">
      If emissions matter, they must be measured all the time — not occasionally.
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Before CEMS: Periodic Sampling</h2>
    <p>
      Earlier compliance relied on manual stack testing.
      While accurate at that moment, it provided no insight
      into day-to-day emissions.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Continuous Monitoring Became Necessary</h2>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>Environmental protection</li>
      <li>Regulatory confidence</li>
      <li>Operator awareness</li>
    </ul>

    <blockquote class="warn">
      CEMS is a system — analyzers, sampling, calibration, and data handling.
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      CEMS exists because occasional measurement was not enough.
      Continuous monitoring protects the environment
      and improves operational accountability.
    </p>
